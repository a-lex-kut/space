> # Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do

I love space theme.  
For me it started with _Space Oddity_ by David Bowie.

>This is major Tom to ground control, I'm stepping through the door  
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way  
And the stars look very different today  
For here am I sitting in a tin can far above the world  
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do

When I was a kid outer space was a mysterious place for me, it was something unknown. And now, thanks to **James Webb space telescope**, we have an ability to see wonderful high-resolution pictures of places that lays far from our planet.
